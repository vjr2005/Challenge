# Prompt Phase 5 — Verify and adjust generated schemes

## Prerequisite

Run `scripts/compare_schemes.sh` after the first successful generation (`scripts/generate.sh`). The script generates `/tmp/tuist-schemes/` with the scheme lists and diffs.

## Input

1. **Complete directory `/tmp/tuist-schemes/`** (generated by `compare_schemes.sh`)
2. `AUDIT_REPORT.md` ('Schemes and Environments' section)
3. Current `AppScheme.swift`

## Reference project

Use `AppScheme.swift` from [Challenge](https://github.com/vjr2005/Challenge) as a reference for scheme factory patterns.

## Task

Analyze the diffs and compare the original project schemes with those generated by Tuist:

1. Identify missing schemes in the Tuist project
2. Identify extra schemes that should not exist
3. For each missing scheme, generate the AppScheme.swift code needed to create it (build config, test targets, launch args, environment variables)
4. Verify that each scheme uses the correct build configuration (e.g., Dev → Debug, Staging → Staging, Prod → Release)
5. Verify that test schemes include the same test targets as the original project
6. Verify that the build configurations (Debug, Release, Staging...) match between both projects

## Format
If adjustments are needed, generate the modified AppScheme.swift Swift code ready to replace.
