# Prompt Phase 8 — Automated build settings diff analysis

## Prerequisite

Run `scripts/compare_settings.sh` and `scripts/validate_migration.sh`. The scripts generate `/tmp/tuist-validation/` and `/tmp/migration-validation/` with all comparison data.

## Input

1. **Complete directory `/tmp/tuist-validation/`** (generated by `compare_settings.sh`)
2. **Complete directory `/tmp/migration-validation/`** (generated by `validate_migration.sh`)
3. The project's current Tuist helpers (`Tuist/ProjectDescriptionHelpers/*.swift`)

## Task

1. Analyze validation_report.txt and identify the checks that failed
2. For the build settings in /tmp/tuist-validation/, compare each pair of equivalent schemes (e.g., 'AppName' original vs 'AppName (Dev)' Tuist)
3. Classify EACH difference as:
   - NOISE: paths, UUIDs, DerivedData, timestamps → ignore
   - COSMETIC: project/workspace/scheme names → ignore
   - FUNCTIONAL: affects the build but is not critical
   - CRITICAL: directly affects the binary (SWIFT_VERSION, SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION, CODE_SIGN_*, OTHER_LDFLAGS, PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER, FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS, etc.)
4. Show ONLY the FUNCTIONAL and CRITICAL differences in a table:
   | Scheme | Setting | Original Value | Tuist Value | Severity |
5. For each CRITICAL difference, indicate which Tuist file needs to be modified and the corrected code
6. Analyze xcdiff.json to detect missing source files or resources
7. Final verdict: PASS or FAIL with a list of corrections

## Format
Report in Markdown with tables. If FAIL, include the corrected Swift code for each affected file.
